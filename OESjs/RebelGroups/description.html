			  in excess of its current rebel size, then it grows according to its global strength. Weaker parties grow faster than stronger rebel groups but can never
			  exceed an absolute growth above 0.5x of its current size in one period. Once a rebel group achieves hegemony (a group size relation defined as 4:1), then the rebel

			  Each rebel group has a predetermined expansion value which is translated into a probability to attempt an expansion. An expansion means that the rebel groups forces
			  a reassignment of a group of enterprises. Depending on the global strength of the rebel groups, this action can trigger reporting and fighting. If the expansion is
			  successful, then the group of enterprises at disposition is reassigned to the victorious rebel group.</td>

			  weaker rebel group than vice versa. The exact amount is based on a probabilistic function.</td>
