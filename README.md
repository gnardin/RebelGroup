# Rebel Groups Protection Racket

## TODO

* Calibrate and validate the model with empirical event data.

## Improvements

* Make RebelGroups' _freqDemand_, _freqExpand_, and _freqAllocate_ random per rescheduling instead of defined randomly on the initial setup.
* Make Enterprises' _income_ random per period instead of a fixed amount defined randomly at the begin of the simulation.
* Include the allocation of external funding to RebelGroups, which may influence Looting/Extortion decision.
* Make Flee Probability endogenous.
