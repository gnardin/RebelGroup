      <p>The potentially relevant object types are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>RebelGroup</li>
        <li>Enterprise</li>
        <li>Household</li>
      </ol>

      <p>These objects coexist in one shared environment. Each object might
        change its own properties and influence the change in the properties of
        others as well. They can share the information about their properties
        together, also about other objects. Objects actions and communication
        are represented as Events.</p>

      <p>Relevant types of events identified for the Mafia model are
        described in the tables below. The tables present the events between two
        objects or just within one object. For example, the events, in table
        Entrepreneur – Customers, triggered by the Entrepreneur will affect the
        Customer or just take some information from him. The Event name column
        describes the name of the event, the Event description column describes
        briefly the logic performed by the event, and the Trigger object column
        defines the object that generates the event.</p>
